                        Season of Mists Epilogue

              In which we bid farewell to absent friends,
             lost loves, old gods, and the season of mists;
                and in which we give the devil his due.

Cover:  Note the four characters in the lower right.  They are Japanese kanji,
and mean:
	1. "new" (JIS 3F37, 13 strokes, bushi/radical 69)
	2. "life" (JIS 4038, 5 strokes, bushi/radical 100)
	3. "baby"? (JIS 3145, 17 strokes, bushi/radical 38)
	4. "man's legs" (JIS 5139, 2 strokes, bushi/radical 10)

The third character's identification is a bit doubtful, as another following
character is normally required to write "baby".  On its own, the character as
written refers to a musical sharp.  However, the interpretation is undeniable,
and the whole sequence is a hidden reference to events that occur in this
issue.
	They could also be Chinese characters, and the third character might be
less ambiguous in that language.

Title:  The phrase "give the devil his due" is a cliche.  It appears in
Cervantes' _Don Quixote_ I.iii.3, but that may not be the original source.

Page 1 panel 2:  The central figure, the most humanoid of the demons, is
probably Choronzon.  The fish have a number of symbolic meanings in
Christianity.  Jesus and his followers were known as "fishers of men" (see
Matthew 4:19), symbolizing human souls as fish; the fish was also a symbol of
the early Christian church, and, by extension, of Jesus himself.
	Panel 3:  We may have seen the big slug-like demon before.

Page 2 panel 3:  Note that Duma has no genitals, though he does have nipples.
Does he have a navel?  See below.  That's the key to Hell lying on his stomach.

Page 3 panel 7:  Dream appears in his Kai'ckul guise for his dinner with Nada.
	Note also the amazing appearing/disappearing candelabra, which may be
seen in page 4 panels 3 and 4 and page 5 panel 3, but which is missing in this
panel, page 4 panel 5, page 5 panel 5, page 7 panel 5 and page 8 panel 5.

Page 4 panel 5:  Note the print, which has Japanese characters.  The larger
block is the signature of the artist.  The birds are a crane and a raven,
perhaps?

Page 5 panel 5:  Hint, boys'n'girls.  This is NOT how to apologize to anyone.
Dream, as we have long recognized, ain't terribly bright.  Jim Lai speculates:

    Of course Dream isn't good at expressing himself in words.  He
    belongs to the preliterate era, the subconscious, which is seldom
    direct (except perhaps in action), preferring symbolic meaning.

We may also note that this panel has a different angle on the room; the room is
not changing decor (except for the candelabra).

Page 6 panel 2:  "Kissed it all better" sounds peculiarly modern, and
idiomatic, for a queen of milennia-past Africa.
	Panel 3:  Oubliette:  "Forgotten-small", from French, meaning a hidden
prison such as found in certain old castles, accessible only from above.  Note
that this contradicts the image of Nada's cell as seen in both _Sandman_ #4 and
#23.

Page 7 panel 5:  Another print, but of what?  Probably a photostat.  Is there a
horse figure in the center?

Page 8 panel 4:  This is the most definite statement that Dream could quit that
I have seen, although we have seen strong indications that he could die or be
removed.  He would be replaced in any event by another incarnation of Dream.

Page 9 panel 1-2:  These are drawn in the classical Japanese "Ukiyo-E" (or
"Floating World") style.  Westerners might be familiar with this style from
the cover of the album _The Best of Emerson, Lake, and Palmer_.
	Panel 6:  Floating Bridge of Heaven:  Probably the rainbow, which
Izanagi and Izanami stood on when they created the island Onogoro.

Page 10 panel 3:  The Floating Kingdom is probably the divine home on the
island Onogoro.
	Panel 7:  Loki, of course, has a long enmity with storm god Thor.  We
may note that he is the "fire-bringer" archetype in Norse myth, which explains
his unusual coiffure.

Page 11 panel 4:  Dream has never explicitly carried out his stated intention
here.  May we assume that he did it off panel?

Page 12 panel 2:  Cluracan is making reference to Egyptian hieroglyphics here,
which are indeed pictographic in form.
	Panel 9:  Unseely Court:  One of the courts of Faerie, based on Celtic
myth, often written "Unseelie".  This is the court of the dark fairies, with
the Seelie Court being the court of the light fairies.  There is some
correspondence between dark and evil, and light and good, but it is not exact.

Page 14 panel 1:  Why forbid the small glamour when it clearly provides relief
to Nuala?  All visitors to Dream's realm cloak themselves in small illusions of
whatever sort, but those illusions are generally the product of their dreams.
In any case, Dream has shown himself before to be autocratic in his own realm,
and has put his dignity before the concerns of others.  Nuala's glamour affords
her control over her own image; Dream allows no one else control of any sort in
his realm; compare the difficulty of "lucid dreaming".  Additionally, the
forbiddance will serve to remind Nuala that she is a servant, not a guest.

Page 15 panel 1:  The first choice would probably be to go on to Heaven or the
equivalent afterlife--that "undiscover'd country from whose bourne no traveler
returns", ignorance of which makes that choice harder.

Page 16-17:  Nada is being reincarnated (as a boy, as we see in page 16 panel
5).  Is Dream promising the new him a lifetime of good dreams?

Page 18 panel 1:  This is our old friend, Lucifer, ex-ruler of Hell.
	Panel 3:  "Crack a tube":  Open a can of beer.  "Sheila" is fairly
uncouth slang for girl, roughly equivalent to Americans' "chick" or "babe".
Never-you-minds:  rhyming slang for "behinds".  Rhyming slang is a form of
Australian (arising from Cockney) slang in which a word or phrase is replaced
by a word or phrase which rhymes with it and whose literal meaning somehow
resonates with the meaning of the replaced word or phrase.  Thus, "trouble and
strife" means "wife".

Page 19 panel 3:  "Worse for wear":  Drunk.
	Panel 5:  " `Strewth":  Long-time _Hellblazer_ readers recognize this
as "God's truth", a minor expletive.  The shortening occured because of a
general reluctance to use the word "God".  Similar examples include the
obsolete " `sblood"; "geez", from Jesus; and "zounds", from "Christ's wounds"
via " `swounds".

Page 20 panel 1:  "Pom":  slang meaning British.  Of uncertain origin, with
many proposed acronymic histories, from "Prisoner of Mother England"
(Australia's colonization was originally for the purposes of serving as a penal
colony; English newcomers would therefore be "pommies").  It may also somehow
arise from "pomegranate".  Folk etymologies are notoriously unreliable,
however.  The short version of the OED labels the etymology unknown.
	Why, though, is Lucifer identifiably British?  Probably he has a
British accent, but why?  (Note that his teeth in panel 4 seem to be quite
white and straight, indications that he's not a victim of the British
orthodontal industry (or lack thereof), although he might have a nasty overbite
in panel 3.  Smilies where appropriate :-)  Obviously, Lucifer is a pog
(Prisoner of God); Australia was Britain's Hell.
	Panel 3-5:  Lucifer's talking to the Creator, here.

Page 21 panel 3:  Remiel refers to the perfection of the name of God.  Note
that Duma does appear to have a navel.
	Panel 4:  Remiel seems to be indicating an unexpected affection for
Duma.

Page 23:  One is tempted to say "the Road to Hell is paved with good
intentions" in response to Remiel's musings.
	Panel 2:  This hearkens back to part one of the tale, where Hell is
introduced as a place that couldn't get any worse.  It's an ironic contrast.
	Panel 5:  "All is for the best, in this best of all possible worlds"
is a theme made vicious and repeated fun of in Voltaire's magnificent and
successful satire, _Candide_.
	Panel 6:  Irony:  Nothing can end happily, in Hell.  The demon shown
here was also seen in the beginning of this tale, as hard at work then as now.

Page 24:  This is Destiny, in his Garden of Forking Paths.  See _Sandman_ #21
for more detail.
	Panel 2-3:  Is Destiny deliberately walking along a joint in the stone
floor of his garden?
	Panel 4:  We saw this book shelved in Lucien's library in _Sandman_
#22.  Others more familiar with Chesterton than I have said that the quote is
typically Chestertonian, although it does not seem to be closer to the
corresponding work, _The Man Who Was Thursday_, than it does to the rest of the
Chesterton oeuvre.
