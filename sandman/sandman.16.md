Page 4 panel 6:  An unusual case of anthropomorphism, for a _place_ to become a
_person_.

Page 5 panel 1:  Dream's assertion that vortices are mortals directly
contradicts Lucien's assumption, issue ten page 14, that the vortex was an
"it", a thing.
	Panel 5:  I suppose I should start keeping a "Canonical list of Sandman
danglers".  This would obviously be one.

Page 9 panel 5:  We need not worry that Fiddler's Green was the historical G.K.
Chesterton, as here he says he was not even a "very good _copy_ of a human"
[emphasis his].

Page 13 panel 2:  Dream is not very bright, indeed.  He has great knowledge,
born of age and, perhaps, his status, but he is not even as capable of insight
as a human.

Page 17 Panel 3:  That's an Iggy Pop CD on the bottom of the panel, _The
Idiot_.  Neil mentions that Lou Reed's _Berlin_ didn't make it into the panel.
	Panel 4-5:  Barbie's life will be more fully explored in a later
storyline.
	Panel 6:  Two books have readable titles:  _Empire of the Senseless_
and _Sleeping in Flame_.  "Sleeping in Flame" is by Jonathon Carroll, an
American writer often writing from Vienna who writes surreal, fantastic, and
often horrific fiction.  This particular book is a modern retelling of the
Rumpleskiltskin fairy tale.  Carroll has a reputation for using dreams or
fictions becoming reality, and it is rumored that Neil Gaiman had to rework the
plot of _The Doll's House_ after reading a Carroll book that used his original
idea.  _Empire of the Senseless_ was written by Kathy Acker in 1988.  Perhaps
coincidentally, she dedicates the book to her tattooist.  It is described as
a postmodern novel, and "not a pretty story."
	Neil indicates that Shirley Jackson's _We Have Always Lived in the
Castle_ and M.R. James' _Ghost Stories of an Antiquary_ were in the script but
didn't make it into the panel.  He notes that this should help people identify
Zelda's short story extract from _Sandman_ #15 and the title of this issue.

Page 18 panel 2-3:  We saw Judy, and the massacre, in _Sandman_ #6.  We will
see Donna in a later storyline.
	Panel 6:  A presumably genuine photo of G.K. Chesterton, who was the
inspiration for "Gilbert".  Note the signature at lower left.

Page 19 panel 1 (right caption):  Talking about dolls probably relates to the
title of this storyline.
	Panel 2:  Note Rose's namesake tattoo.
	Panel 7:  "And then she woke up" is the conclusion to, among other
things, _Alice's Adventure's in Wonderland_ and the movie [blech!] version of
_The Wizard of Oz_.

Page 20 panel 6:  A fox's "set" is hunter's jargon for a den.  It is therefore
unusual for Jed to use it.

Page 21 panel 5:  Note that Desire's sigil is different from issue ten, and
that the order of sigils is peculiar (Desire to the left of Death).

Page 22 panel 1:  Desire's costume is in many ways reminiscent of Catwoman's, a
villain of Batman's.  However, felinity often seems to have an erotic effect,
and that may be its purpose here.
	Panel 7:  Another of the unspoken rules that govern the Endless,
apparently.  Disaster of some sort would strike were Dream to slay kin of the
Endless.  We saw a possible hint to this in _Sandman_ #10, where Rose is warned
of the "Kindly Ones", and a later issue also uses the Eumenides as a threat.

Page 23 panel 4:  Delirium is the name of the Endless whose sigil is the swirly
one to the right of Despair's on issue 10 page 4.

Contributors include:
	Col. G. L. Sicherman (gls@cbnewsh.cb.att.com) defined "set."
	David Goldfarb (goldfarb@ocf.berkeley.edu), Viktor Haag
<vehaag@crocus.waterloo.edu>, and Jim W Lai (jwtlai@watcgl.waterloo.edu)
combined to identify Rose's reading material.
	Neil Gaiman, via Tanaqui C. Weaver (cen@vax.oxford.ac.uk) expanded on
material in Rose's room.
	David Goldfarb (goldfarb@ocf.berkeley.edu) speculated on the nature of
an Endless disaster.
