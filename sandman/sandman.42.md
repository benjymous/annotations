                         The Annotated Sandman

                       Issue 42: Brief Lives Two
              Neil Gaiman, Jill Thompson, and Vince Locke

Notes:  See #41.

1: It Always Rains on the Unloved
	From "Peanuts", the comic strip written by Charles Schulz, as said
by Charlie Brown, a karmically oppressed child.

Page 1 panel 6:  We have not yet been told the identity of Dream's lover.
We know that she has appeared before, that she is not one of his former
lovers, that the relationship lasted a "handful of months", and that she
is in the "waking world".  I lean toward Thessaly, given the above and
that Neil asked his GEnie forum if they were interested in seeing
her again, about the time he was planning _Convergence_.

2: Wet Dreams
	"Wet dreams" is a pun here; it actually refers to dreams that
result in orgasm.  There is a demented song by Kip Adotta called "Wet
Dream", consisting mostly of fish puns.

Page 4 panel 5:  Nuala's stone is probably not very significant, although
it might be one of the twelve Dreamstones (others including Dream's Ruby
and the Porpentine).

Page 5 panel 2:  Mervyn has been seen in #5, as a bus driver, and in
_Season of Mists_.  He is probably derived from Jack Pumpkinhead, a
character in L. Frank Baum's Oz books.  His name is probably a reference to
Mervyn Peake, a British author/illustrator, known for the "Titus" books:
_Titus Groan_, _Gormenghast_, and _Titus Alone_.  These books are gothic
fantasies, set in a large castle.
	Panel 3:  Flick it:  A curious euphemism for a supposedly mature
book.  Obviously meant to be "fuck it"; note that all-caps comic book
lettering causes "flick it" and "fuck it" to look very similar.

Page 7 panel 4:  Eleanora:  An alternate spelling for Alianora, who was
seen in _A Game of You_.  It has been speculated that "Eleanora" is really
Eleanor of Aquitaine.
	Panel 6:  Dead balloon:  The more usual phrase is "went over like a
lead balloon".

3: A Fishing Expedition
	Source?  "Fishing expedition" is the term used when detectives in
detective fiction cause trouble because they don't have any questions
to ask, i.e., they're fishing for clues.

Page 8 panel 1:  Sub-basement?  Did Something Nasty in the Basement get
demoted?  Promoted?
	Panel 2:  Note the "hunny" pot, a reference to A.A.Milne's Winnie
the Pooh books.  Jill Thompson has said that she drew this sequence after
Ernest Shepard's illustrations in Milne's books.
	Panel 3:  The bottle imp may be a reference to the Grimm fairy tale
"The Imp in the Bottle" (see also _Doom Patrol_ #54).
	Panel 4:  Abel's song is a popular WW I shanty.  Drop the stutter
and the "mm hm er" bits and he's got the chorus correct.

4: She Kisses Wyverns (The Disneyland Analogy)

Page 11 panel 2:  The wyvern says "She said she was your sister".

Page 12 panel 3:  Note the wyvern's delirious eyes.
	Panel 5:  Note that Delirium's clothing has changed.  Her clothing
changes at least once an issue.

5: Dinner Etiquette and Chocolate Lovers

Page 13 panel 4:  Apparently, Neil meant for the servitor's name to be
Taramis, not Tamaris.  Lance Smith writes:

    Taramis? Not Taranis? Or maybe Tarani? (Taranis is a Gaulish deity that
    the Romans likened to Jupiter, though it may have been a death goddess.
    Tarani is Sanskrit for savior and is a title for the sun.)

Page 14 panel 4:  The female servitor may be another person pulled in from
the Dreaming, as in _Season of Mists_, or she may be the Fashion Thing.
This latter is suggested by the eyepatch (as seen on the other eye in
2:15.1).

Page 15 panel 2:  Del is altering a common playground taunt: "<X> and <Y>
sittin' in a tree, K-I-S-S-I-N-G/First comes love, then comes marriage,
then comes baby in a baby carriage."
	Panel 4:  Squidging:  Childish slang for squeezing.  Note this
balloon should be multicolored.
	Panel 9:  Note the "brief lives" reference, an example of a common
motif.  The phrase "copulating desperately" was also used in 5:18.3, in a
scene with Mervyn Pumpkinhead.

6: Desire Swears by the First Circle

Page 19 panel 4:  Desire's sigil is, of course, its heart.
	Panel 5:  First Circle?  Other Side of the Sky?  Sword and the
<something>?  Note that the Other Side of the Sky might refer to the Faerie
realms, or it might refer to Destruction's eventual destination.  The First
Circle may be the circle of angels seen in _Books of Magic_ #1, while the
Sword may be Michael's (or Aziraphale's) fiery sword.  Alternately, the
First Circle may be a reference to Dante's Inferno, where Hell was a series
of concentric rings, which was itself derived from older Fertile Crescent
myths, including one where Ishtar passed through a city of circles in the
underworld.  The oaths may also revere to the Endless themselves:  The
First Circle is Death, the beginning and the end, and the Sword is
Destruction's sigil; the Other Side of the Sky may be Despair's realm on
the backs of mirrors.
	Panel 8:  Gleet: Inflammation of a bodily orifice or the discharge
therefrom, as from a venereal disease.

7: "Things Are Changing"
	Possibly a reference to a Bob Dylan song.

Page 20 panel 2:  We know from Sp1:5.4 that Delight had become Delirium
by at least Greece's Heroic Age.

8: What Can Possibly Go Wrong?
	A common statement by main characters, inevitably disastrously wrong.

Page 21 panel 1:  Note the effect Delirium has had on the Dreaming (see
also 41:13.2).

Page 23 panel 2:  Pharamond:  No refs.  Possibly an obscure Fertile
Crescent figure?

Page 24 panel 4:  Interesting color rainbow.  The colors run in the real
world, from the inside out:  violet, blue, green, yellow, orange, red.
