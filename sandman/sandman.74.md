                                Issue 74: "Exiles"

                            Neil Gaiman, Jon J Muth / Michael Zulli [??]

This story is similar to #39, _Soft Places_.

Cover:  The cover seems to have a lot in common with the "Vertigo Tarot"
images, in particular the Two of Cups.  It's got the dark, almost
earthen-looking frame, and the theme of reversibility.  The final
version of the Cup 2 has two nude torsos.  This cover also has the fossil
seashell image in it that shows up in the Tarot quite often.  On the other
hand, it's in warm colors where the Two of Cups is blue -- perhaps
this reflects the desert that dominates the story inside.

	   The writing on the frame is Chinese.  The glyph in the circle at the
top seems to be a "chop", or several characters representing a name, sometimes
used as the equivalent of a signature.  The next one down is not a Chinese
character but a picture of a flower against some mountains; perhaps this
is meant to symbolize the White Lotus.  The next means "older brother", and
the next two mean "magic".

	   The smaller characters in red and white further in are upside-down.
The characters in white are Japanese rather than Chinese, as they include
hiragana.  They're hard to read.

        The large lettering on the two tables seems to be Japanese rather
than Chinese, and in a calligraphic style meant more for ornament than
legibility.  The smaller characters on the upper table (in shadow) are
definitely Japanese, but mirror-reversed for some reason.  Also at the lower
right of the frame is a small scrap of paper with Japanese writing, perhaps
from a newspaper.

Page 3 panel 2: The Nan Shan mountains are the northeastern most boundary of
the plateau of Tibet.

Page 4:  The White Lotus was a Buddhist sect that appealed to the lower
classes.  It's known to have existed as early as the 13th century C.E.
The "White Lotus Rebellion" lasted from 1796 to 1804.

Page 5 panel 1: According to report, this incident is based on something
that happened to Gaiman himself.
       panel 4: No refs on whether there really was or is a town called Wei
in western China.

Page 6 panel 5: In Chinese and Japanese mythology foxes are considered
spiritual beings with magic powers.

Page 14 panel 2: Morpheus refers to 39:21.1 -- the story "Soft Places".
The young man was Marco Polo.

Page 15 panel 1: No refs on this story.  The parallel with Dream and Orpheus
is pretty obvious.

Page 16 panel 2: P'eng Tsu was a scholar reputed to have lived from the
12th to the 2nd century BCE.  (Or perhaps from the 2nd century BCE to
the 8th CE.  My source is unclear.)  He is to the Chinese the proverbial
long-lived man, much as Methuselah is in the West.

Page 18 panel 6: A famous line from a Japanese poem reads, "As I crossed
the bridge of dreams".  In that poem the bridge represents death or a vision
of death.  Master Li has previously met with a Dream who is now dead; now
he crosses to the realm of the one who lives.

Page 19 panels 1-4: These horsemen were also seen in #39. However, these men
appear to be Roman soldiers, whereas the Soft Places horsemen where dressed as
Mongols.

Page 21 panel 4: "Tools can be the subtlest of traps" is quoted from the
text piece from the "Doll's House" collection.  Morpheus said he would
never have thought of destroying his ruby (7:20.4); but this Dream, wiser,
knows from the start that someday he must dispense with his greatest tool.

Page 23 panel 5:  Note that Master Li's cry when he wakes is the same syllable
as the laughing mechanical sailor from page 17.
