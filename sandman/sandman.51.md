Page 3 panel 8: Not Kansas? Awww... It's worth noting that Buddy Holly
(whose music is playing) died in an Iowa field in a snowstorm. In a plane
crash rather than a car crash, to be sure.

Page 5 panel 4: A hedgehog with very similar speech patterns, named
Redlaw, appeared in volume 3 of "The Books of Magic" miniseries. This
isn't necessarily the same one, of course.

Page 6 panel 5: A "free house" is a pub or inn with no ties to a brewery,
as opposed to a "tied house", where the land or pub is owned by the brewery 
and the publicans are merely tenants. The main difference is that a free 
house canserve any beer they wish, while a tied house will usually only 
sell beers produced by the brewery the pub is tied to. In the context of the 
story, the inn is a free house in that it's tied to no one world or reality 
stream.
           panel 6: Abdera: according to Brewer's _Dictionary of Phrase and
Fable_, a Thracian seaport, proverbial for stupid inhabitants although it 
produced several noted philosophers. No refs on the particular story. 
The name Menton may be a reference to Minneapolis-area guitarist and vocalist 
Todd Menton, who certainly either knows Gaiman or knows friends of his.

Page 7 panel 3: Webster's dictionary defines "chirurgeon" simply as
an archaic synonym of "surgeon".

Page 8 panel 1: As we will learn, the travelers in this inn tell stories.
This is Brant's, although not one that follows traditional narrative style.

	   panel 5: In Greek myth, the centaur Chiron taught medicine to
Asklepios, who went on to become the patron demigod of doctors. His 
credentials as a physician are thus fairly impressive. He also served as 
Herakles' childhood tutor.

Page 9 panel 4: The man with the beer stein at left foreground is wearing
a distinctive hat, the same worn by noted fantasy writer (and friend of
Gaiman's) Steven Brust. Neil Gaiman confirms that it's meant as a cameo.
           panel 6: There was a knight of the Round Table named Gaheris,
brother to Gawaine.
	   Panel 7: By Charles Dickens, of course.

Page 11 panel 6: Compare 36:23:4 and 37:19:2-4.

Page 20 panel 7: Given that the restaurants are always closed, I can't
help wondering what Robert is finding to eat. His beard is growing,
so he's not somehow exempted from normal bodily functions.

Page 22: Odd that whenever two real people meet, one of them
immediately returns to the real city. Coincidence, perhaps.

Page 23: Another inn, in which other tales are told; Robert's story
turns out to be a story-within-a-story.

Credits: 
	Greg "elmo" Morrow (morrow@physics.rice.edu) created the Sandman
annotations, forwarded much useful commentary on "World's End", and helped
reference Chiron the centaur.
	D. W. James (vnend@princeton.edu) suggested that Todd Menton
somehow found his way to the inn of World's End, and noted Steven Brust.
	Lance "Squiddie" Smith (lsmith@cs.umn.edu) noted the Buddy Holly
connection, and corrected "Worlds'" vs. "World's". He also explicated the
term "free house" and noted Steven Brust's appearance.
