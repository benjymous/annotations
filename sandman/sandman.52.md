# The Annotated Sandman

## Issue 52

##### Neil Gaiman, John Watkiss, Bryan Talbot, Mark Buckingham

Second story in the anthology "Worlds' End"

**Cover**: Note the photograph, which will turn up as next issue's cover, and the vines from last issue's. The covers for "Worlds' End" have layers and multiple references just as the stories inside do.

  **Necropolis**: "city of the dead".

**Litharge**: lead monoxide -- perhaps a substance used as an embalming agent?

- #### Panel 3

  **Quinsy**: suppurative tonsillitis. Derived from the Greek "kunanche"; as we will see in issue 55, many of the names around Litharge seem to be Greek-derived. "Spartan quality goatskins": a reference to Trojans, a brand of condom.

- #### Panel 4

  **fusty**: "smelling of the cask".

- #### Panel 5

  The uniformed ape resembles Prinado, a character from the earlier arc "A Game of You". They both also resemble organ grinder's monkeys, of course.

- #### Panel 6

  **The OED uses several quotations from people named Klaproth**: Julius von Klaproth, an 18th century traveler and writer; and Martin Heinrich Klaproth, a chemist after whom some minerals are named.

  Cluracan, as longtime _Sandman_ readers will recall, first appeared in the arc "The Season of Mists" -- 26:1, to be precise.

- #### Panel 1

  A noble family of Imperial Rome bore the name "Aurelius". The city of Aurelia seems to be modeled on Rome in a number of ways.

  **Carnifex**: Latin for "executioner" (literally "meat-maker").

  The statue on the right resembles a real-life statue (of Apollo? Augustus Caesar? - can't remember). The statue was made, I think, by Michaelangelo.

- #### Panel 5

  We can infer that Aurelia's history has been similar to that of Italy; an empire has given way to a collection of city-states.

  Nuala was given to Dream as a gift in that same issue #26.

- #### Panel 3

  Traditionally, the fair folk cannot bear the touch of cold iron.

- #### Panel 4

  "Mab" is a traditional name for the queen of the fay; see for instance _Romeo and Juliet_, act I scene 4.

- #### Panel 1

  **Psychopomp**: a god who directs dead souls to their final resting place. As we will see, the religion of the plains seems to give its head direct power over the afterlives of its followers.

### Page 8

- #### Panel 4

  I can't help wondering if this ruler is a gentle poke at Dave Sim in return for his _Sandman_ parody. Like Cerebus, he combines the roles of Prime Minister and Pope; like Cerebus, he taxes heavily and threatens those who disobey with pain in the afterworld. And "Carys" sounds vaguely similar to "Cerebus".

- #### Panel 8

  Roman legend had it that the city was founded by twins who became gods: Romulus and Remus.

- #### Panel 5

  Cluracan is now fully clothed, when only 2 panels previously, he was stripped to the waist. Also, is left eye is no longer bruised. In the next panel, Nuala explains to her brother that he is dreaming. No surprises there.

### Page 17

- #### Panel 2

  Cluracan's bruised eye is back. Either this was a slip-up, or he's beginning to wake up. (He is fully clothed and unbruised in the next panel, which indicate that he's still dreaming.)

### Page 20

- #### Panel 6

  Suddenly, Cluracan's bruised eye has been healed. And all "before the sun [had] set". I'll be charitable, & say that he used some Glamour to cover it up.

- #### Panel 1

  That tower doesn't look like it has as much room upstairs as was shown on page 21...

  An inconsistency: on page 21 panel 9, the Psychopomp & Cluracan go _down_ into the room, via a hole in the floor; yet here, the Psychopomp is falling out of a window at the _top_ of a building.

- #### Panel 5

  The two human characters are old DC fantasy characters named Claw the Unconquered and Stalker the Soulless.
