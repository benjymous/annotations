Page 1 panel 1: Every Hempel-drawn issue has a string or cord in this panel.
This issue: an electrical cord going into a manhole. The man is the angel
Remiel, who was last seen at the end of "The Season of Mists", issue #28.
Note the shadow: his feet do not quite touch the ground.

Page 2 panel 3: A reference to [Bible quote].
       panel 4: See the annotations for issue #24 for more information on
Remiel and Duma.

Page 5 panel 6: Reportedly this speech is paraphrased from Sir Walter Raleigh.
Raleigh, however, said "regrets" rather than "consequences".

Pp. 8-9: I don't recognize either of these characters.

Page 10: This is "Puss in Boots". I don't have on me a specific reference to
her story. 

Page 12 panel 3: Note the Tori Amos poster on the wall. The other poster is
most likely Iggy Pop, but could conceivably be for the comic strip "Ziggy".
	   panel 4: The poster is the character "The Man", from the series 
_Breathtaker_, written by Mark Wheatley and drawn by Marc Hempel.

Page 13 panel 9: This is the first of a number of references to Rose's looking
younger than her true age. There's been speculation that she's stopped aging
because of giving away her heart at the end of "The Doll's House"; in many
tales a being who takes out their heart and hides it gains immortality.
Gaiman's own character Mad Hettie (see issue #3, and the "Death" miniseries)
has done so.

Page 14 panel 3: Those wishing to learn more about Rose's family tree are
directed first to issue #1, then to the "Doll's House" story.
	   panel 5: Montel Williams is an LA-area talk show host. "Vixen
LaBitch" is fictional, as far as I know. Her dialogue refers to accusations
of child molestation leveled against pop star Michael Jackson: one of his
hit songs from the mid-'80s, "Billie Jean", had a line, "The kid is not
my son"; "Beat It" was another hit song from the same album, but LaBitch
is using the phrase as a slang term for masturbation.

Page 15 panel 2: Carmilla Bristol seems to be fictional.

Page 16 panel 4: An echo: these two women are dressed the same as Chantal
and Zelda, two characters from "The Doll's House".
	   panel 7: Stheno and Euryale were two of the three Gorgons, hags
from Greek myth with snakes for hair and faces so terrifying that merely to 
look upon them was to be turned to stone. The third was Medusa, who was 
slain by the hero Perseus.

Page 17 panel 5: These three are the Hesperides, another trio of women from
Greek myth. Retrieving apples from their garden was one of the labors of
Hercules. In some tales the Gorgons did in fact live near this garden.

Page 18 panel 2: In most versions the guardian of the apples was called
Ladon, and had as many as a hundred heads. The three-headed Geryon was 
slain by Hercules, but in a different one of his labors. No doubt Gaiman 
has brought Geryon in here so as to have yet another occurrence of the 
number three.
	   panel 5: In Greek myth, the apples of the Hesperides did not confer immortality. Norse myth does feature golden apples in this role, though.

Page 20 panel 4: We've seen this chest before, in 27:20:1-2. The contents
are the same: a pocket watch (perhaps Prez's?); Haroun al-Raschid's magical
Baghdad; the demon Azazel, pent in a bottle; and the skull of the Corinthian.

Page 21 panel 2: According to Brewer's _Dictionary of Phrase and Fable_,
Abudah was "A merchant of Bagdad, haunted every night by an old hag; he
finds at last that the way to rid himself of this torment is to 'fear God
and keep his commandments' -- _Tales of the Genii_."
