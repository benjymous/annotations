## Issue 64: "The Kindly Ones: 8"

##### Neil Gaiman, Teddy Kristiansen

- #### Panel 1

  For the first time, the recurring strings are replaced with a literal string, and one not part of the surrounding scene. And a string very close to being cut...

- #### Panel 2

  These children are reminiscent of the stories of E. Nesbit. No specific reference, though.

- #### Panel 3

  Arabic(?) myth gives the name "salamander" to elemental fire spirits, reptilian in form.

### Page 2

- #### Panel 1

  "The snows of yesterday" is a reference to the French poet Francois Villon, who wrote, "Where are the snows of yesteryear?".

- #### Panel 2

  At the end of "The Season of Mists", Dream's old love Nada was reborn into the body of a boy in Hong Kong. This may be the same boy.

The art style here is much more Japanese than Chinese.

- #### Panel 5

  Presumably Dream is the standing figure, looking much as he did in issue #9. Note an Afrikaner tribal god as well as a native one... and note that the actual decision is left quite ambiguous.

- #### Panel 1

  Dream is in the process of creating this nightmare in 11:10.

- #### Panel 4

  "Via lacrimae" is Latin for "road of tears". Quite what the significance is I'm not sure.

- #### Panel 1

  Continuing the pattern of having a dwelling place in the panel with the title and credits.

- #### Panel 3

  As seen in 63: 5-8, of course.

### Page 5

- #### Panel 2

  A fairy-tale has seven princes transformed into swans. They are restored using jackets made of nettles; but there aren't enough nettles to complete all of the jackets, so the youngest brother is left with a swan's wing instead of an arm.

  It is of course impossible to tell whether this young woman is Foxglove, of "A Game of You" and the "Death" miniseries.

- #### Panel 3

  The sign's language is unidentified. It is similar to Hungarian, but not identical. (Hungarian for "Do not feed the pigeons" is "Ne etesd a galambokat".)

- #### Panel 6

  This house seems similar to the one in Florida where Rose stayed during "The Doll's House". It doesn't seem to be identical, however.

- #### Panel 5

  **Domesday Book**: A census of British holdings taken by the Normans shortly after their conquest in 1066.

- #### Panel 1

  This snow is awfully deep considering that the ground was bare only a few days ago...

### Page 11

- #### Panel 3

  An echo of "Brief Lives" part 4 -- 44:20.

### Page 13

- #### Panel 2

  Ruby's death in "Brief Lives", of course, and the destruction of Nada's city.

- #### Panel 2

  Note, again, the claws of brass.

- #### Panel 3

  Interesting that it is the Maiden who delivers death by age.

### Page 18

According to report, Hecate was shown in statues as a trio of women; one holding a whip, one holding a sword, and the center holding a torch.

- #### Panel 2

  Tony Curtis delivered Matthew's quote in the movie, "The Black Shield of Falworth" (1954).

- #### Panel 2

  Lamb stew, eh? Well, once you've let the animal's spirit free, no sense in wasting its body, I suppose. "John Bauer" is most likely the artist from around the turn of the century, known for illustrating Swedish fairy tales such as "In the Troll Wood".

  And then again, perhaps it was that she was heartless.
