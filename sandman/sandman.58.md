# Issue 58: "The Kindly Ones: 2"

##### Neil Gaiman, Marc Hempel, D'Israeli

**Cover**: Benjamin Disraeli (1804-1881) was Earl of Beaconsfield and Prime Minister of England. The inker's pen name is probably derived from him, although he did not spell his name with an apostrophe.

- #### Panel 4

  Evidently he was rocking the boat...

- #### Panel 7

  Lyta calles Lieutenant Pinkerton "Lieutenant Pinkwater" -- tip of the hat to Daniel Manus Pinkwater, National Public Radio commentator and author of the classic young adult books _Lizard Music_, _The Last Guru_ and _Young Adult Novel_, as well as several books for younger readers.

  Gaiman and Pinkwater have been known to hang out on each other's discussion fora on GEnie. (This was back in '93-'94; not sure if it's still the case)

- #### Panel 3

  Cluracan was of course last seen in [issue 56](sandman.56.md); his sister Nuala in [issue 52](sandman.52.md).

- #### Panels 3-5

  In [47:14](sandman.47.md#page-14).4 we see (in a panel from Destiny's book, whose location in time is uncertain) a white-haired, white-clad Dream that looks somewhat like this figure. It's unclear as yet whether this is a plot point or just an echo.

### Page 9

> [marginThumb] ![page 09](thumbnails/sandman.58/page09.jpg)

- #### Panel 4

  In an interview in "Comics Buyers Guide" Gaiman states that the story of Cluracan's nemesis isn't going to be resolved before the title ends. Sigh...

### Page 11

- #### Panel 7

  "La Belle Dame sans Merci" (French: "The Beautiful Merciless Lady"): a poem, written in 1819 by John Keats, about a young man pining away for love of an elf-maiden.

### Page 14-16

In Jungian psychology, if you have a dream in which you go down to a basement, it means that you are confronting something from your subconscious. Here, Lyta is confronting the fact that her son may be dead. (C.f. Rose's dream in #65, 5, 7.)

- #### Panel 6

  The recipe is from _Macbeth_ act IV scene 1:

  > **First Witch** Round about the cauldron go;<br/>
  > In the poison'd entrails throw.<br/>
  > Toad, that under cold stone<br/>
  > Days and nights has thirty-one<br/>
  > Swelter'd venom sleeping got,<br/>
  > Boil thou first i' the charmed pot.<br/>
  >
  > **ALL** Double, double toil and trouble;<br/>
  > Fire burn, and cauldron bubble.<br/>
  >
  > **Second Witch** Fillet of a fenny snake,<br/>
  > In the cauldron boil and bake;<br/>
  > Eye of newt and toe of frog,<br/>
  > Wool of bat and tongue of dog,<br/>
  > Adder's fork and blind-worm's sting,<br/>
  > Lizard's leg and owlet's wing,<br/>
  > For a charm of powerful trouble,<br/>
  > Like a hell-broth boil and bubble.<br/>
  >
  > **ALL** Double, double toil and trouble;<br/>
  > Fire burn and cauldron bubble.<br/>
  >
  > **Third Witch** Scale of dragon, tooth of wolf,<br/>
  > Witches' mummy, maw and gulf<br/>
  > Of the ravin'd salt-sea shark,<br/>
  > Root of hemlock digg'd i' the dark,<br/>
  > Liver of blaspheming Jew,<br/>
  > Gall of goat, and slips of yew<br/>
  > Silver'd in the moon's eclipse,<br/>
  > Nose of Turk and Tartar's lips,<br/>
  > Finger of birth-strangled babe<br/>
  > Ditch-deliver'd by a drab,<br/>
  > Make the gruel thick and slab:<br/>
  > Add thereto a tiger's chaudron,<br/>
  > For the ingredients of our cauldron.<br/>
  >
  > **ALL** Double, double toil and trouble;<br/>
  > Fire burn and cauldron bubble.<br/>
  >
  > **Second Witch** Cool it with a baboon's blood,<br/>
  > Then the charm is firm and good.

- #### Panel 1

  Granddaughter on the mother's side, most likely...

- #### Panel 3

  **An echo**: twice before the three witches have appeared to answer three questions. Once when summoned by Dream in [issue 2](sandman.02.md), and once to Rose Walker in [issue 10](sandman.10.md).

### Page 17

> [marginThumb] ![page 17](thumbnails/sandman.58/page17.jpg)

- #### Panel 3

  **Dragnet**: A radio show, then a television show, purporting to dramatize actual cases of the LA police department.

### Page 18

> [marginThumb] ![page 18](thumbnails/sandman.58/page18.jpg)

- #### Panel 3

  No refs on these figures or the name "Ruthven", other than that Gaiman used the name for a minor character in [issue 1](sandman.01.md).

### Page 19

> [marginThumb] ![page 19](thumbnails/sandman.58/page19.jpg)

- #### Panel 6

  No refs on any of Cluracan's titles...

### Page 21

> [marginThumb] ![page 21](thumbnails/sandman.58/page21.jpg)

- #### Panel 3

  Morpheus and Nuala seem oddly ignorant of the events recounted in [issue 52](sandman.52.md). We can speculate that the reality storm sent Cluracan back in time, but things aren't that simple: Queen Titania would likely have noticed her ambassador arriving before he left. Further, there is no evidence in that story of the events shown in this.

### Page 23

> [marginThumb] ![page 23](thumbnails/sandman.58/page23.jpg)

- #### Panel 7

  Nuala's crystal in was given her by the last Dream's lover as seen in [issue #42, page 4](sandman.42.md#page-4), panel 5.

- #### Panel 9

  An echo of "A Game of You". That story also concerned a crystal that could be used to summon Dream for a boon.
