Page 3 panel 5: Such as the death of an Endless?

Page 4 panel 4: Gangster story? The only story we've seen that isn't 
identifiable from this list would be "A Tale of Two Cities", from #51, but 
that one hardly seems describable as a gangster story. Perhaps she's referring 
to the man who won November 1937 in a poker game, or perhaps a story told 
downstairs while Brant was hearing about Prez.
           panel 5: Horatio Alger (1832-1899) was known for stories of poor but
honest boys making good through hard work.

Page 8 panel 7: Given that the Endless embody aspects of reality, if a storm
is caused by the death and replacement of one of them, then both theories are
equally true. There has been only one before, and as we were reminded last
issue, an Endless has died and been replaced once before.

Page 9 panel 4: The return of Steven Brust, seen once before in 51:9:4.

Page 10: The song is part of the Gaiman-written "Generic Folk Song".

Page 13: OK, time to play "name the characters". This one is Destiny, of course.

Pp. 14-15: The man with the flag, judging by his coat and vest, is Lucien. Some
netters have speculated that the first pallbearer is Desire (who otherwise is
noticeably absent from the proceedings), and the second (with red hair) is 
Loki.  The big question is who is in the coffin. Opinions vary, but the most 
popular guess is Dream, with Orpheus a distant second.

Pp. 16-17: Going roughly from left to right: Nuala, Abel, Mervyn Pumpkinhead,
Cain, Luz, Wilkinson, Queen Titania, Matthew the raven, Bast, Despair, an angel
(perhaps Remiel), Odin, Thor, Emperor Norton, probably Gregory the Gargoyle,
Gilbert/Fiddler's Green, and Martin Tenbones.

Page 18: Finally, Delirium and Death. In the introduction to the "Death 
Gallery", Gaiman relates a story from the Kabala, that the Angel of Death 
collects souls through love: when you see it(/him/her) you fall in love so 
quickly that your soul is drawn out through your eyes. 

Page 22 panel 4: There are numerous Hindu gods and goddesses represented with
multiple arms. We can infer that the landlady was one such who lost all her
worshippers, and took refuge at the inn before returning to the Dreaming. 

Release History:
Version 1.0 released 31 May 94.
