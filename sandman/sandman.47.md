Notes:  See #41.

Cover:  Maps on the cover:  The map to the right seems to be a map of
China.  It is several centuries old, since the typography uses the `long s'
form of the letter.  The map behind the _Sandman_ logo is unidentified.
The object that Dream is holding is the M.C. Escher woodcut "Four-Faced
Planetoid" from 1954.

1: Cooking Considered as One of the Fine Arts

Page 1 panel 2:  Note the ecologically-correct webbed shopping bag.
	Panel 4:  As theorized in #48 page 16, the Endless embody both their
name and their opposite.  Hence, Destruction includes creation, which
explains his sculpture, painting, and cooking.

Page 2 panel 6: Is this meant to represent Ishtar?

Page 3 panel 6:  Barnabas is a *real* dog.  Admittedly, he's a real
*talking* dog, but he's not a human in a dog's body the way Matthew is a
human in a raven's body (the superficial characterization of #40 aside,
Matthew still *acts* human).  Incidentally, chocolate is not particularly 
healthy for dogs; they have trouble digesting it and they, like the rest 
of the Carnivora, overreact to stimulants.

2: "My Envelope Isn't Any Good Anymore"

Page 5 panel 2:  Note the curlicues used for Del's eyes.  The envelope is
addressed to "Santa Claus/The North Pole".  Santa Claus is an American 
mythical figure who brings gifts to children; he is said to live at the North
Pole.  Children write him letters.

3: Where All Mazes Meet

Page 6 panel 3-7:  This sequence is reminiscent of _The Chronicles of
Amber_, by Roger Zelazny.  In that book, the members of the royal family of 
the eternal city Amber are able to walk among the shadowy reflections of
Amber, adding and subtracting bits of reality until they get to a
reflection which matches their desired destination.  Gaiman's description
of Dream and Delirium's walk is very similar to Zelazny's description
of shadow-manipulation.
	Note that the maze gradually changes from man-made to naturally
grown.

4: The Other Side of the Coin
Note that throughout this sequence, Dream stays on the path, Destiny stays
off the path, and Delirium charts her own course.

Page 8 panel 3:  The statue of Destruction is facing in the opposite direction
as the statues of the rest of the family.  There is no obvious path leading
to it.

Page 10 panel 6:  Del may be imitating the posture of her statue.

Page 11 panel 2-5:  Note the white core to Del's balloons.  In panel 4,
Del's eyes should be the same color.  (Del is repeating what she said in
#21.)

Page 12 panel 2:  Del's eyes should be the same color again.

5: Life as a Glass of Bitter Wine

Page 13 panel 2:  Delirium considers Destiny's "little flappy things"
equivalent to Dream's ravens or Despair's rats (#41).

Page 14 panel 1:  This event (as yet undetailed) occurs just before #1 and
is referred to in the "What Has Gone Before" introduction to _The Doll's
House_.
	Panel 2:  See Dream's description in #21, and the _Death: The High
Cost of Living_ miniseries.  According to Jill Thompson, the ox drover 
is no one particularly important.
	Panel 3:  It seems probable that this is a depection of a future 
event; the color of Dream's clothing and hair is significant.

6: Cherries Are Counted, and a Bargain Is Made

Page 15 panel 2:  Dream's cloakpin is supposed to be colored silver.  It is
not Dream's ruby, which was destroyed in #7.
	Panel 3:  Orpheus as "not very old": All lives are brief, from the
perspective of the Endless.
	Panel 5:  Note that Del has given the flower wings.

Page 19 panel 3:  Delirium is using an old counting rhyme which is supposed
to reveal your occupation when you grow up.  (Modern readers may be
familiar with its use as a title for a couple of works: _Tinker, Tailor,
Soldier, Spy_ by John LeCarre and _Rich Man, Poor Man_ and _Beggarman,
Thief_, novels and television miniseries by Irwin Shaw.)  Del omits "thief" 
in her rhyme; the continuation in panel 5 is her own invention.

Page 20 panel 5:  See #41 for the source of the epitaph.

Page 21 panel 3:  This island, Destruction's refuge, was seen in #41.

7: An Unlikely Growth

Page 24 panel 1:  Troth:  An archaic term for faithfulness or a promise,
especially a promise to marry; extended by similarity to equal "truth".
	Panel 4:  Dolmades:  a Greek dish, grape leaves stuffed with ground
meat.  /-es/ is a Greek plural ending.
