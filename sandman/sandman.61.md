Page 1 panel 1: Every Hempel-drawn issue of "The Kindly Ones" has had a string
of some sort in the very first panel. Here, a strand of spider silk.
       panel 4: As mentioned previously, the hero Perseus.

Page 4 panel 6: Hollow? Empty? One might almost say heartless...

Page 5 panel 1: Zelda was last seen in issue #15, "The Doll's House" part 6.
She was blond in that issue, although her hair could have been bleached. 
"The Doll's House" featured a gay man named Hal, who moved west; before this,
many people on the net thought that Rose's dying friend was him -- almost
certainly an intentional bit of misdirection on Gaiman's part. Given the
theme of gender that runs through "The Kindly Ones", Rose's friend would have
to be a woman, though.
	  panel 4: An echo of 15:2:4.

Page 8 panel 7: Note the water glass is identical to the one that the Gorgons
gave to Lyta.

Page 10 panel 1: The raven Jessamy appears in issue 29, "Thermidor". That
story took place in the late eighteenth century.

Page 11 panel 1: Previous to the "Crisis on Infinite Earths", Superman's
home planet of Krypton had a glass forest similar to this one.

Page 12 panel 2: Titania's was last seen in issue #52. Her appearance here
is identical to that of issue #18, "A Midsummer Night's Dream". This is
especially notable because in four Gaiman-written stories it is the first
time she's had the same form.

Page 14 panel 3: I must confess I have no idea what this is supposed to mean...
	   panel 6: Auberon, in issue 18, is shown with ram's horns. A man
whose wife is unfaithful is also traditionally referred to as "horned".

Page 15 panel 1: I'm sure Geryon is simply petrified at the prospect...
	   panel 2: Scenes in the waking world have white gutters and page 
border; scenes in the Dreaming are in grey. Note what happens to the border
here.
	   panel 4: I don't know what significance claws of brass have. "Nimbic
glimmering" is perhaps derived from "nimbus", a halo of light denoting power.

Page 21 panel 4: An echo, perhaps, of page 9 of issue 12 ("The Doll's House" 
part 3).

Page 22 panel 3: In Norse myth, Ragnarok was brought on when Loki killed the
god Balder with, yes, a sharpened sprig of mistletoe. Three years of constant
winter ensued, and then the end of the world.

Page 24 panel 6: This echoes the death by fire of Ruby the driver in #44
("Brief Lives" part 4); and both of these echo the destruction of Nada's
city seen in issue #9.

Release history:
Version 1.0 released 1 Nov. 94.
