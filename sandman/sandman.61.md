                           The Annotated Sandman

                       Issue 61: "The Kindly Ones:5"

                    Neil Gaiman, Marc Hempel, D'Israeli

Page 1 panel 1: Every Hempel-drawn issue of "The Kindly Ones" has had a string
of some sort in the very first panel. Here, a strand of spider silk.
       panel 4: As mentioned previously, the hero Perseus.

Page 4 panel 6: Hollow? Empty? One might almost say heartless...

Page 5 panel 1: Zelda was last seen in issue #15, "The Doll's House" part 6.
She was blond in that issue, although her hair could have been bleached. 
"The Doll's House" featured a gay man named Hal, who moved west; before this,
many people on the net thought that Rose's dying friend was him -- almost
certainly an intentional bit of misdirection on Gaiman's part. Given the
theme of gender that runs through "The Kindly Ones", Rose's friend would have
to be a woman, though.
	  panel 4: An echo of 15:2:4.

Page 8 panel 7: Note the water glass is identical to the one that the Gorgons
gave to Lyta.

Page 10 panel 1: The raven Jessamy appears in issue 29, "Thermidor". That
story took place in the late eighteenth century.

Page 11 panel 1: Previous to the "Crisis on Infinite Earths", Superman's
home planet of Krypton had a glass forest similar to this one.

Page 12 panel 2: Titania's was last seen in issue #52. Her appearance here
is identical to that of issue #18, "A Midsummer Night's Dream". This is
especially notable because in four Gaiman-written stories it is the first
time she's had the same form.

Page 14 panel 3: I must confess I have no idea what this is supposed to mean...
	   panel 6: Auberon, in issue 18, is shown with ram's horns. A man
whose wife is unfaithful is also traditionally referred to as "horned".

Page 15 panel 1: I'm sure Geryon is simply petrified at the prospect...
	   panel 2: Scenes in the waking world have white gutters and page 
border; scenes in the Dreaming are in grey. Note what happens to the border
here.
	   panel 4: I don't know what significance claws of brass have. "Nimbic
glimmering" is perhaps derived from "nimbus", a halo of light denoting power.

Page 21 panel 4: An echo, perhaps, of page 9 of issue 12 ("The Doll's House" 
part 3).

Page 22 panel 3: In Norse myth, Ragnarok was brought on when the god Balder was
killed. Seven years of constant winter (Finbulvinter) ensued, and then  the end
of the world.
It was Loki that tricked a blind God, I don't remember which, into shooting an
arrow of misteltoe at Balder.
The story was that the Gods had heard that Ragnarok would be impossible as long
as Balder was alive. So the Gods went out to all living and dead creatures, and
asked them not to kill Balder. They all promised to do so. 
But the gods forgot the misteltoe. 
So Loki, being jealous of everyone more popular then him, took his revenge. 
The Gods were all playing about, shooting things at Balder, and having fun when
he didn't die, when Loki shows up.

Page 24 panel 6: This echoes the death by fire of Ruby the driver in #44
("Brief Lives" part 4); and both of these echo the destruction of Nada's
city seen in issue #9.
