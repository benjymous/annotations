                            The Annotated Sandman

                      Issue 57: "The Kindly Ones: 1"

                          Neil Gaiman, Marc Hempel

"The Kindly Ones": Translation of Greek "Eumenides".  Terrifying hags who
pursue those who slay their own kin; really named "Furies", called "kindly" 
as a euphemism.  As with many Greek myths, exact details vary: Aeschylus had 
a whole chorus of them; other sources number them at exactly three and name 
them Tisiphone, Alecto, and Megaera.  Gaiman follows this version; we see 
exactly three Furies in Hades in the "Song of Orpheus" -- unsurprising, 
given the recurring Triple Goddess character.  In "Three Septembers and a 
January" Desire vows to bring the Kindly Ones down on Dream's head (31:21:5), 
and it's implied in "The Doll's House" that if Dream had killed his great-niece
Rose Walker this would have happened.  Now Dream has killed his son Orpheus...

Cover: The tape is medieval German; someone identified it as from the 
_Nibelungenlied_, the saga that Wagner drew on for his "Ring" cycle.

A note on layout: this arc is dedicated to an aspect of the Triple Goddess; 
the page layouts are almost entirely based on a six- or nine-panel grid. 
Six and nine are, of course, multiples of three.

Page 1: Here we see the Triple Goddess, as we have before, in the aspect of
the witches from the old "Witching Hour" series, which is also the aspect of
the Fates from Greek myth. 
The first panel of each installment of "The Kindly Ones" until the tenth has 
some sort of thread-like object in it.
       panel 1: The maiden, Clotho, spins the yarn from which lives are woven.

       panel 3: The mother, Lachesis, knits the yarn.

       panel 3: The mother, Lachesis, knits it.

Page 3 panel 6: Specifically in 21:2:4. In this, the last long _Sandman_ arc,
there are many echoes of the past: old characters return, and things seen
before recur.  Loose ends are tied up (or snipped off!) as the story draws to
a close.

Page 4 panel 5: Possibly an echo of the frogs Delirium makes in "Brief Lives"
#3 -- 43:10.5.
       panel 6: According to chronological references given elsewhere, Daniel
is almost three years old by now.  His general appearance and speech patterns
are oddly youthful.

       panel 7: The crone, Atropos, cuts the thread of life. There's been
speculation about just whose thread was cut: some say Daniel Hall; some
say Dream. Perhaps the thread is a metaphor for the story itself: we, the
readers, want it to continue indefinitely, but it has to be ended sometime.

Page 5 panel 4: An echo: this man looks very similar to Andros, the priest of
Orpheus, from "Brief Lives".  He even has red flowers such as sprouted where
Orpheus' blood touched the ground. It seems rather unlikely that it is actually
him, though.

Page 6 panel 4: The Baskin-Robbins chain of ice cream stores advertises "31
Flavors".  The store Lyta and Carla visit has 57; this may be an amalgamation
with Heinz Co.'s "57 varieties" of tomato products.  Note that 57 is a 
multiple of 3 where 31 is not.

Page 7 panel 5: Note the 99 on the sign, another multiple of 3.
       panel 6: Foreshadowing -- your key to quality literature.

Page 8 panel 1: The title page of each installment of "The Kindly Ones" 
features a character approaching another's dwelling, frequently after
some sort of separation or estrangement.  Here Matthew approaches Dream's
castle to speak to him.

Page 9: This sequence, where Matthew visits each of the characters in the
Dreaming in turn, is oddly reminiscent of the story in the "Vertigo Jam".

Page 11 pane 3: Note the crescent moon, a female symbol.  The women in
this story are frequently accompanied by them.

Page 12 panel 1: John Webster (1580?-1625?) is best known for the plays
"The Duchess of Malfi" and "The White Devil".
        panel 2: Lucien is quoting T.S. Eliot's poem _Whispers of Immortality_: 
"Webster was much possessed by death / And saw the skull beneath the skin; /
And breastless creatures under ground / Leaned backward with a lipless grin."

page 13 panel 4: An echo: the Corinthian played a large role in "The Doll's 
House".  In 14:35:4 Dream said he would remake him.

page 15 panel 6:  Aristeas of Marmora -- referenced in Issue 30 (see
annotations for Issue 30)

Page 17 panel 1: "Lux": Latin for "light"; cf. "Lucifer", "Light-Bearer".
        panel 3: Alan Moore's short story "A Hypothetical Lizard" begins,
"Half her face was porcelain."  Of course, in that story it was the right half,
not the left.

Page 18 panel 1: To my knowledge, we've not seen Eric Needham before. 
        panel 3: Michael Eisner is head of Disney Studios.  Michael Ovitz
is a high-powered agent and deal-maker, called "The most powerful man
in Hollywood" by _Newsweek_ magazine.
        panel 4: The song is "These Foolish Things", by Jack Strachey and 
Eric Maschwitz, English lyrics by Harry Link.  A notable line not quoted:
"Oh, how the ghost of you clings."

Page 19 panel 7: Before the changes made to DC Universe continuity by the
"Crisis on Infinite Earths", Lyta was a character on Earth-2, the daughter
of that Earth's Wonder Woman and Steve Trevor.  Currently there exists only
one Earth, and only one Wonder Woman.  Roy Thomas created a new but similar
character for the series "The Young All-Stars": the "Golden Age Fury", who
received power from the Furies.  Current continuity is as given in the next
few panels.
        panel 8: The Fury did not wear this costume in "The Young All-Stars".
The couple that adopted her was the superheroine Miss America and an 
Admiral Steve Trevor, created by Roy Thomas pretty much in order that Lyta 
could keep the surname "Trevor".

Page 20 panel 1: The group was "Infinity, Inc.", and had its own series.
        panel 2: Well, hey. Superheroes lead strange lives.

Page 21 panel 2: The return of Lucifer, last seen in issue 28 on an Australian
beach.  The mute waitress is the demon Mazikeen from issue 23, the half-mask 
hiding the rotted, skinless horror that is the left half of her face.
        panel 3: The song is actually entitled "Memory".  It is based on the 
poems "Preludes" and "Rhapsody on a Windy Night". Lucifer is clearly a being 
of highly refined taste.
        panel 6: The song is called "Sit Down, You're Rocking the Boat".  It's
from the musical "Guys and Dolls"; music and lyrics by Frank Loesser.  Two 
notable lines not quoted: "And the Devil will drag you under/By the sharp 
lapel on your checkered coat".

Page 23 panel 3: It's winter...rain in L.A. is all but unknown at any other 
season.
