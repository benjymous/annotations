- #### Panel 2

  On the off-chance that anyone is reading this story without knowledge of the rest of the _Sandman_ series, let me note that the man here is recurring character Robert "Hob" Gadling. He was born in the 14th century, and allowed by a whim of Dream and Death to live to the present day.

- The view shown is the entrance to the Minnesota Renaissance Festival held in Shakopee, Minnesota. According to report, Zulli visited it specifically to gather visual reference.

- #### Panel 1-3

  Of course, we know about all these other historical members of the Gadling "family".

- On the theme of "People must change", he we see Hob really has had plenty of time to reconsider his part in the past.

- #### Panel 7

  **Milton Keynes**: a "New City" in England built in the 1960s. Best known for having numerous (traffic circles) and [Concrete Cows](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concrete_Cows).

- #### Panel 1

  Gadling is punning on a line from Andrew Marvell's poem "To His Coy Mistress". The original has "love" rather than "lamb".

- #### Panel 2-3

  The bearded man seen in these two panels is noted fantasy writer (and friend of Gaiman's) Steven Brust. He was last seen at the Worlds' End Inn -- [56:9](sandman.56.md#page-9).7.

- #### Panel 1

  According to report, Wild West shows are in fact quite popular in England, and have about the same degree of realism to them.

- #### Panel 3

  This is the ending of Kipling's poem "The Sack of the Gods". We know, of course, that at least some souls do reincarnate; Nada did at the end of "The Season of Mists", and if Gaiman follows Alan Moore's theology in _Swamp Thing_ Annual #2, then it's an option for blessed souls in Heaven.

- #### Panel 5

  The two women at the foreground right are The Fabulous Lorraine Garland and Emma Bull. The Fab. Lorraine is Gaiman's personal secretary; Emma Bull is a noted SF and fantasy writer. The two of them together compose the Flash Girls, a singing duo who have recorded several of Gaiman's songs.

  Possibly echoing [6:4](sandman.06.md#page-4).1 -- "If you keep [stories] going long enough, they always end in death."
