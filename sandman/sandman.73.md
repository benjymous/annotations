Page 1 panel 2: On the off-chance that anyone is reading this story without
knowledge of the rest of the _Sandman_ series, let me note that the man here 
is recurring character Robert "Hob" Gadling.  He was born in the 14th century,
and allowed by a whim of Dream and Death to live to the present day.

Page 4: The view shown is the entrance to the Minnesota Renaissance Festival
held in Shakopee, Minnesota.  According to report, Zulli visited it
specifically to gather visual reference.

Page 9 panel 7: Milton Keynes: a town in England named after the noted
economist.

Page 11 panel 1: Gadling is punning on a line from Andrew Marvell's poem
"To His Coy Mistress".  The original has "love" rather than "lamb".
       panel 2: The bearded man seen here and in the next panel is noted
fantasy writer (and friend of Gaiman's) Steven Brust.  He was last seen
at the Worlds' End Inn -- 56:9.7.

Page 12 panel 6: English beer is commonly served warm.  English people
commonly look down upon American beer.

Page 16 panel 1: According to report, Wild West shows are in fact quite
popular in England, and have about the same degree of realism to them.

Page 18 panel 3: This is the ending of Kipling's poem "The Sack of the Gods".
We know, of course, that at least some souls do reincarnate; Nada did at
the end of "The Season of Mists", and if Gaiman follows Alan Moore's theology
in _Swamp Thing_ Annual #2, then it's an option for blessed souls in Heaven.

Page 22 panel 5: The two women at the foreground right are The Fabulous
Lorraine Garland and Emma Bull.  The Fab. Lorraine is Gaiman's personal
secretary; Emma Bull is a noted SF and fantasy writer.  The two of them
together compose the Flash Girls, a singing duo who have recorded several
of Gaiman's songs.

Page 24 panel 5: Possibly echoing 6:4.1 -- "If you keep [stories] going
long enough, they always end in death."

Release History:
Version 1.0 released 6 November 1997.
