- #### Panel 2

  As with [How They Met Themselves](sandman-how-met.md) it's interesting to see Desire referred to as _her_ rather than the usual _it_.

  It's hard to know if this island is entirely fictional, or if Gaiman had a real island in mind. One possible contender is the [isle of Eynhallow](https://www.bbc.com/travel/article/20170721-why-you-ceynhallow-which-you-can-visit-one-day-a-year) in the Orkneys, north of Scotland.
