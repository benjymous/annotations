#### Panel 1

This is not the same person who brought Brant the stew in 51:9: the neckerchief is green instead of red, and there is no beard stubble.

**Call me Jim**: An allusion to the opening line of Herman Melville's _Moby-
Dick_, "Call me Ishmael"; possibly combined with Joseph Conrad's _Lord
Jim_.

#### Panel 1

**The great ship**: No refs. Mother Carey: An Anglicization of the Latin "Mater Cara", an epithet of the Virgin Mary. She was known as a protector of sailors.

#### Panel 6

The title is a pun on the English philosopher Thomas Hobbes (1588-1679), whose best-known work was called _Leviathan_.

**Leviathan**: A great sea monster referred to in the Bible; see for instance Isaiah 27:1.

Pears" -- "stairs".

#### Panel 4

Note the resemblance between this king and the stow- away. The story itself is apparently an old Indian folk tale.

**Rukh**: More familiarly rendered as the Roc of Madagascar. From "The Second Voyage of Sinbad the Sailor".

#### Panel 3

The phrase "Golden Road to Samarkand" turns up in the works of British poet James Elroy Flecker. I haven't been able to find this specific passage, though.

#### Panel 3

It's clear that the stowaway is an immortal. If this is indeed the king from the tale, then he very likely has a perfect right to call Hob Gadling "young".

#### Panel 3

In the Kindly Ones arc, Hob Gadling mentions a previous wife of his called Peggy. (Don't have the exact reference.) Could "Jim" be the same person he mentions?

#### Panel 2

There is a sea-ballad called "The Handsome Cabin Boy". Kate Bush has recorded it, among others.
