Page 1 panel 1: Note the blue roses here and later.  Michael Zulli's 
contribution to the "Death Gallery" was captioned, "In Death's garden all the
roses are blue." 
 
Page 2 panel 3: The beast on the left is the one which sent Brant Tucker
off the road at the start of "Worlds' End".  (51:2.2)  Note the Siamese
cat at the lower right, perhaps the cat-prophet from "Dream of a Thousand
Cats".  And at the far right of the back row, hard to make out because of
the shading, is Dave Sim's character Cerebus the Aardvark.  (Delirium made
a winged Cerebus in part 8 of "Brief Lives" [48:15.5].)

Page 5 panel 1: The flowers here appear to be calla lilies (or perhaps
spathiphyllum [peace lilies]), hydrangea, digitalis (foxglove), and roses.
       panel 5: The goat-headed fay on the left is called Skarrow, and
last appeared in "A Midsummer Night's Dream". (19:passim)  The being between
Mad Hettie and Hob Gadling is probably the Borghal Rantipole, last seen in 
that form in 66:20.3.

Page 6 panel 6: Long-time readers will of course recognize Dream's absent
brother Destruction, last seen in part 8 of "Brief Lives" (48:23.3).

Page 7 panel 4: Sitting at the left is Darkseid, a major villain of the 
mainstream DC Universe.  At far right is the Emperor Norton, last seen in 
issue #31.  At the time this issue came out, both of these entities were dead,
although Norton rather more permanently so.

Page 9 panel 3: Cheshire is the most popular cheese historically in England. 
It's also the oldest. It's very salty after a brief exposure, though one tends
not to notice at first. It's a member of the cheddar family, but it can't 
really be made outside Chester county in England because of the high salt 
content in the soil there.

Wensleydale is a blueveined, rich cream cheese. It has perhaps the best
aftertaste of any cheese.  Neither of the cheeses looks like the wheel in Destruction's hand.

Page 11 panel 1: Wesley Dodds was the superhero known as "The Sandman".  In 
the real world, he was the first character to bear that name.  He has appeared
once before in this series, in 1:18.4-6.  The meeting he refers to took place 
in the _Sandman Midnight Theatre_ special.
        panel 2: Dian Belmont was Wesley's lover.  (Later his wife?)

Page 15 panel 1: This is Leib-Olmai, the Alder Man, who became a bear to evade
Dream and Delirium's search for Destruction. (44:4.5)  He was supposed to have
been informed that it was safe to return.  Perhaps he liked the bear-shape.
        panel 2: The boy in the front row, second from the right, resembles 
Steven, the protagonist of Gaiman and Zulli's _The Last Temptation_.  The two
men in the third row on the right-hand side are Zulli and Gaiman themselves.
        panel 3: The girl with the balloon is Shivering Jemmy of the Shallow
Brigade, whom DC's "Lords of Chaos" sent to bargain with Dream for Hell
in "The Season of Mists".  She was last seen at the end of that story. (27:
21.5)  Chaos's opponents, "The Lords of Order", also sent a representative;
from the caption, he was meant to appear here, although Zulli did not draw
him.
        panel 4: This is Faramond, who gave up being a Babylonian deity in
favor of being a travel agent.  He was last seen in "Brief Lives" part 6.
(46:8.6)
        panel 5: This is  Alianora, one of Dream's old lovers.  The affair 
ended badly, although the exact details are not known.  She was last seen at 
the end of "A Game of You" (36:35.2).

Page 17 panel 4: The boy holding the lyre is Dream's son, Orpheus.  We saw
him last at the end of "Brief Lives" (49:5.4 and in flashback on 49:19).

Page 19 panel 1: The man in the coat just to the left of Lyta Hall is
Doctor Destiny, or Doctor Dee.  He was last seen in 7:23.1.
        panel 4: The sequence that follows echoes the one at the end of
issue 1 (1:34-37), with reversals that work on numerous levels.  This
Dream gives mercy instead of punishment; the cat that Burgess follows is
white instead of black; we go from the tower to the hallways instead of
the other way around.

Page 20 panel 6: The placing of a mark on Lyta's forehead with a kiss
recalls both God's mark on Cain (although again the intent is opposite)
and Glinda the Good Witch's mark on Dorothy in _The Wizard of Oz_.

Page 23 panel 2: When Ric Madoc went to sleep (70:15.6) the flowers around
him were all blooming.  Strange that they're now all dead.

Page 24 panel 1: Some people have expressed confusion over the phrase "all
but one".  That one is you, the reader.
        panel 2: It was the French.  They used to say it when they had kings.
